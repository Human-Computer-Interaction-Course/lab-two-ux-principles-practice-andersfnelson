        <h1>Usability Reccomendations</h1>
        <p>I used Google's PageSpeed Insights and Pingdom on the Brookfield Zoo website. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce the use of third party code: Google says that third party code blocked
                the main thread for 760 milliseconds.  The site could improve performance by loading this
                code after the main site components have loaded.
            </li>
            <li>Another thing that could be done to improve performance would be reducing the use of URL redirects.
                It looks like there are many instances of the browser being told to go to another location when the page is loaded.  
                This means that nothing can be rendered until the HTML document arrives.
            </li>
